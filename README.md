# HiFi Prototype Smart PillBox Interface DEMO 

##About
The HiFi Prototype was a part of a long term class project in Designing the User Experience. We were required to create a product and go through phases of research, user experience groups / study, prototypes, and more. This was a HiFi prototype that followed our LowFi paper prototype. 

The Demo shows how the physical Smart PillBox we designed may work. The Smart PillBox was a sticky note sized device for customers who needed to take their pills on the go. It included multiple alarms for persons and could be set to vibrate, sound, and both. There are two numbered slots to match with the two alarms. These slots are the physical location where the pills would go.

## Documentation
You can find the entire documentation process including links to videos and designs in the FinalDocumentation document in the Documentation folder. While the project was completed by 5 persons, the HiFi prototype was completed by me only in about 1 hour.

There is a folder with images of the LowFi paper prototype as well.

## Video
You can find the video for the HiFi program [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVsfcLbdqSE).

A video was created for a mock Kickstarter campaign. It is a video about the Smart PillBox product that was being developed. It can be found [here](https://youtu.be/UWskZbVnZQw)
