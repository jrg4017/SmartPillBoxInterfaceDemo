# HiFi Prototype Smart PillBox Interface DEMO 
The HiFi Prototype was a part of a long term class project in Designing the User Experience. We were required to create a product and go through phases of research, user experience groups / study, prototypes, and more. This was a HiFi prototype that followed our LowFi paper prototype.

The Demo shows how the physical Smart PillBox we designed may work. The Smart PillBox was a sticky note sized device for customers who needed to take their pills on the go. It included multiple alarms for persons and could be set to vibrate, sound, and both.
